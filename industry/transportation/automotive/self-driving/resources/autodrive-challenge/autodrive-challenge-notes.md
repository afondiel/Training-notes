# SAE AutoDrive Challenge Notes

## Overview

The [SAE AutoDrive Challenge](https://www.autodrivechallenge.com/) is a multi-year competition that brings together university teams to design and demonstrate autonomous vehicles capable of navigating urban environments. 

The competition adheres to SAE Level 4 automation standards, as defined in [SAE J3016](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3016_202104/). 

AutoDrive Challenge II, the current series, spans four years and uses the Chevy Bolt EUV platform in partnership with General Motors and other industry leaders.

## Objectives

1. **Develop Autonomous Systems**: Teams tackle real-world challenges in perception, localization, planning, and control.
2. **Foster STEM Innovation**: Promotes collaboration between academia and industry while preparing students for careers in mobility.
3. **Evaluate Progress**: Provides a platform to benchmark algorithm performance in urban driving scenarios.

## Competition Phases

The challenge unfolds over three key stages:

1. **Year 1 - Conceptualization**: Focus on system design, sensor integration, and initial algorithm development.
2. **Year 2 - Implementation**: Testing autonomous navigation in simple urban scenarios.
3. **Year 3 - Advanced Scenarios**: Operating in complex environments like [MCity](https://mcity.umich.edu/), a controlled urban testbed.
