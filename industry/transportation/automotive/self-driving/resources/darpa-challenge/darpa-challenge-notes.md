## Key Milestones

### 1. **The 2004 DARPA Grand Challenge: A Humble Beginning**
   - **Objective:** Create autonomous vehicles capable of navigating a 142-mile desert course within 10 hours.
   - **Results:** Every entrant failed, with most vehicles crashing or breaking down within a few miles. The best-performing vehicle, from Carnegie Mellon University, traveled only 7.4 miles.
   - **Impact:** Though no vehicle completed the challenge, it spurred a collaborative and competitive spirit among academic, industrial, and hobbyist teams. It also highlighted the gap between theory and practical implementation in robotics systems.

### 2. **The 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge: First Success**
   - **Objective:** A similar challenge, requiring vehicles to navigate a rugged 132-mile course in the Mojave Desert.
   - **Breakthroughs:**
     - Stanfordâ€™s "Stanley" (Volkswagen Touareg), equipped with advanced LIDAR, GPS, and machine learning algorithms, completed the course in under 7 hours, winning the $2 million prize.
     - Innovations included improved sensor fusion techniques and real-time path planning, enabling autonomous vehicles to adapt dynamically to obstacles.
   - **Impact:** This event marked the first major proof of concept for autonomous navigation.

### 3. **The 2007 Urban Challenge: Expanding Scope**
   - **Objective:** Autonomous vehicles had to navigate a 60-mile urban environment, obeying traffic rules, avoiding dynamic obstacles, and interacting with other vehicles.
   - **Breakthroughs:**
     - Tartan Racing (Carnegie Mellon) won with their Chevy Tahoe, leveraging advanced probabilistic algorithms for decision-making under uncertainty.
     - Teams implemented more sophisticated software, integrating decision-making modules for traffic handling, multi-agent scenarios, and human-vehicle interaction.
   - **Impact:** This competition demonstrated the potential for deploying autonomous systems in real-world environments, laying the foundation for commercial applications.
