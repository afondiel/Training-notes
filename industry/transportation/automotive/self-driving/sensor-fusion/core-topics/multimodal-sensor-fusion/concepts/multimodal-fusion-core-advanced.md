## Introduction
### What: Core Definition and Purpose
Multimodal sensor fusion is the process of integrating data from multiple sensors (e.g., cameras, LiDAR, radar) to produce a more accurate and comprehensive representation of the environment. This technique is crucial for applications where a single sensor type is insufficient to capture all necessary information.

### Why: Problem It Solves/Value Proposition
Multimodal sensor fusion addresses the limitations of individual sensors by combining their strengths and compensating for their weaknesses. This leads to improved accuracy, reliability, and robustness in perception systems.

### Where: Application Domains
Multimodal sensor fusion is widely used in:
- Autonomous Vehicles: Combining camera, LiDAR, and radar data for object detection and navigation.
- Robotics: Enhancing perception and decision-making in robots.
- Surveillance: Integrating video, audio, and motion sensors for security monitoring.
- Healthcare Monitoring: Combining data from various medical sensors for patient monitoring.

## Core Concepts
### Fundamental Understanding
- **Basic Principles**:  
  - Sensor Types: Different sensors (e.g., cameras, LiDAR, radar) capture different types of data.  
  - Data Fusion: Combining data from multiple sensors to create a unified representation.  
  - Fusion Levels: Data can be fused at different levels, such as raw data, feature, or decision level.  

- **Key Components**:  
  - Sensors: Devices that capture data from the environment.  
  - Fusion Algorithms: Techniques for combining sensor data (e.g., Kalman filter, Bayesian inference).  
  - Unified Representation: A comprehensive model of the environment created from fused data.  

- **Common Misconceptions**:  
  - More sensors always improve performance: Proper fusion and calibration are crucial for effective integration.  
  - Fusion is only for advanced systems: Advanced fusion techniques require significant computational resources.

# Initialize Kalman Filter

kf.x = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])  # Initial state
kf.F = np.eye(3)                  # State transition matrix
kf.H = np.eye(3)                  # Measurement function
kf.P *= 1000.                     # Covariance matrix
kf.R = np.eye(3) * 0.1            # Measurement noise
