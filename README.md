# Research Notes

## Overview

As a Software Engineer Consultant, I've had the chance to work in **automotive industry** in diverse subjects such as electrification and sustainability, safety and comfort, but also in **agriculture industry**.

So, I decided to gather some resources from my work experiences and projects that any Software Engineer looking to get into any tech industry might find useful. These resources include core skills, tools, and projects.

## Motivation

The big picture behind this project is to create an "Hello World" documentation, a sort of [Whole "Software Engineering" Catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Catalog) for anyone who wants to start a career as Software Engineer or in a particular Computer Science subfield, weither he's a newbie or a more experienced programmer. 

## Notes 

From requirements, design, programming language to testing. You may also find some research papers and notebooks about AI, [LLMs](https://github.com/afondiel/ChatGPT-Prompt-Engineering-DeepLearningAI), ML, DL, NLP, IoT, robotics and much more.
