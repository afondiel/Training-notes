# Research Notes

## Overview

Throughout my consulting job as Software Engineer I had a chance to work with many clients from different industries such as Automobile safety & comfort, electrification and sustainable innovations to Agriculture, etc. 

I decided to gather some notes from my personal experiences and projects about those essential resources that any Software Engineer should have when working in any industry. This includes : skills, tools, drawbacks, etc. 

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to build a kind of `Whole "Software Engineering" Catalogue` for any industry.

The main idea behind this project is to an "hello world" documentation for anyone who want to start a career in Computer Science & Software Engineering either you are a newbie or an advanced programmer. 

As a Lifelong-Learner and someone who supports Free Knowledge/Education, I hope you may find this helpful as I do.

## Notes 

From requirements, design, programming language to testing. You also find some research papers and notebooks about AI, [LLMs](https://github.com/afondiel/ChatGPT-Prompt-Engineering-DeepLearningAI), ML, DL, NLP, IoT, robotics and much more.
