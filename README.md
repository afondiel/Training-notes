# Research Notes

## Overview

Software Engineering & Computer Science resources documentation from requirements, design, programming language to testing.
There is also some research papers and notebooks about AI, ML, DL, NLP, IoT, robotics and much more.

## Goal

The main goal of this project is to build a `Hello World` resource for any of the [Topics](#popics) below and make it fun & ease to understand for every Software Engineer or Computer Scientist who wants to start a computer science exploration around fun subjects.
