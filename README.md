# Research Notes

## Overview

Throughout my consulting job as Software Engineer I had a chance to work with many clients from different industries such as Automobile safety & comfort, electrification and sustainable innovations to Agriculture, etc. 

There I decided to take some notes of skills needed but also the drawbacks I encontered as Software Engineering & Computer Science resources. 

As `Henry Ford` once said : "Anyone who keeps learning stays young." Therefore, I strongly believe Knowledge and Education should be `Free` for anyone if we want to build a better and more equitable world. 

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to build a kind of `Whole "Software Engineering" Catalogue` for any industry.

The main idea is to create a `Hello World` input resource for any Software Engineer or Computer Scientist either a newbie or an advanced and more exprienced programmer. 

## Notes 

From requirements, design, programming language to testing. You also find some research papers and notebooks about AI, ML, DL, NLP, IoT, robotics and much more.
