## **Introduction**

Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that integrates mechanical engineering, electronics, computer science, and AI to design and operate autonomous systems capable of performing complex tasks across various industries (eg: Robots).

---

## **Key Concepts**
- **Actuators and Sensors**: Robots use actuators (e.g., motors) to produce motion and sensors (e.g., cameras, LIDAR) to perceive their environment.
- **Perception**: Enables robots to interpret sensory data to understand their surroundings. Techniques include computer vision, sonar, and tactile sensing.
- **Control Systems**: Algorithms that direct a robotâ€™s actions based on goals and sensor data.
- **Navigation and Path Planning**: Techniques like SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) help robots find paths in unknown environments.
- **Autonomy Levels**: Ranges from simple, remote-controlled machines to fully autonomous systems capable of complex decision-making.
- **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**: Studies how robots can interact with humans safely and efficiently.

---

## **Applications**
- **Manufacturing**: Robotics enhances precision, speed, and safety in tasks like assembly and welding.
- **Healthcare**: Robotic systems assist in surgeries, diagnostics, and patient care, improving outcomes and accessibility.
- **Agriculture**: Robots perform crop monitoring, harvesting, and pesticide spraying, optimizing labor and resources.
- **Service Industry**: Robots in retail and hospitality enhance customer service, e.g., by providing assistance or inventory monitoring.
- **Defense and Exploration**: Robots enable remote exploration and surveillance in hazardous or inaccessible environments.

## **Robotics Perception and Decision-Making Models**
1. **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: A technique for creating maps in an unknown environment while tracking the robot's location within it.
2. **Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM)**: For path planning, PRM uses random sampling to navigate complex spaces.
3. **Markov Decision Processes (MDP)**: Defines decision-making problems in stochastic environments, useful for autonomous navigation.
4. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Robots learn optimal behaviors through trial and error based on rewards, useful in dynamic, uncertain environments.
5. **Kalman Filtering**: Estimates a robot's location by combining noisy sensor data for applications like GPS and visual tracking.

---

## **How Robotics Systems Work**
1. **Sensors Gather Data**: Sensors like cameras, LIDAR, and IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units) collect environmental data.
2. **Data Processing**: Algorithms process sensor data for object recognition, localization, and environmental mapping.
3. **Planning and Decision-Making**: Based on the current map and location, robots plan optimal paths or actions using models like A* or Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.
4. **Control Execution**: Control systems translate high-level plans into motor commands.
5. **Feedback Loop**: Robots continuously update plans based on new sensor data, adapting to changes.

---

## **Types of Robotic Systems**
- **Industrial Robots**: Designed for repetitive, high-precision tasks (e.g., welding arms).
- **Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs)**: Navigate and perform tasks in dynamic environments (e.g., warehouse robots).
- **Collaborative Robots (Cobots)**: Work safely alongside humans in tasks like assembly and quality control.
- **Medical Robots**: Provide assistance in surgery, rehabilitation, and diagnostics.
- **Humanoid Robots**: Robots that mimic human form and movement, often used in research and HRI studies.
- **Agricultural Robots**: Specialized for tasks like crop monitoring, harvesting, and soil analysis.

---

## **Practical Exercises**
1. **SLAM Implementation**: Use LIDAR data to implement SLAM and generate a map of a room or small environment.
2. **Object Detection with OpenCV**: Build a basic object recognition system to detect common items.
3. **Path Planning in a Maze**: Implement an A* algorithm to navigate a maze based on simulated sensor data.
4. **Reinforcement Learning Navigation**: Create a reinforcement learning model to train a robot to reach a goal.
5. **Manipulation Task**: Control a robotic arm to perform a simple pick-and-place task using inverse kinematics.

---

## **Challenges & Limitations**
- **Power Consumption**: Many robots are battery-operated, limiting their operational time and capabilities.
- **Computational Requirements**: Real-time processing of sensor data requires substantial computational resources.
- **Environment Variability**: Real-world environments can be unpredictable, challenging robot autonomy.
- **Safety Concerns**: Robots must be designed to avoid harm to humans, especially in collaborative settings.
- **Sensor Noise and Inaccuracy**: Sensor data can be noisy or distorted, complicating tasks like localization and mapping.

## **Hello World: Sample Code for Robot Navigation Using A* Path Planning**

```python
import heapq
import numpy as np

def a_star(grid, start, goal):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    open_set = []
    heapq.heappush(open_set, (0, start))
    came_from = {start: None}
    g_score = {start: 0}
    
    while open_set:
        _, current = heapq.heappop(open_set)
        
        if current == goal:
            path = []
            while current:
                path.append(current)
                current = came_from[current]
            return path[::-1]
        
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            neighbor = (current[0] + dx, current[1] + dy)
            if 0 <= neighbor[0] < rows and 0 <= neighbor[1] < cols and grid[neighbor] == 0:
                tentative_g_score = g_score[current] + 1
                if neighbor not in g_score or tentative_g_score < g_score[neighbor]:
                    g_score[neighbor] = tentative_g_score
                    f_score = tentative_g_score + np.linalg.norm(np.array(neighbor) - np.array(goal))
                    heapq.heappush(open_set, (f_score, neighbor))
                    came_from[neighbor] = current
