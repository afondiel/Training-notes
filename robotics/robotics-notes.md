## What's Robotics ?

Interdisciplinary branch of engineering and computer science. Robotics involves design, construction, operation, and use of robots.

## What's Robots Do ?

- Work in extreme environments too dangerous for people : 
	- war or nuclear zones
	- sub-sea areas
	- outre space
	- Drones
