=============== REGRESSION NOTES ==============

- Invented by Francis Galton (1886)

* Goal: 
    - Study correlation between prices
    - Magnetude of relationship (between variables, features of a system ..)


* Applications : 
- medecines (medical models)
- Business (consummer behavior, firm productivity, competiveness of public/private sector)

* Model (Y = Xb + e)

(price) 
^  
|  /
| /
|/
+++++-> (surface/size)

X -->[  ? ]--> Y

where : 
- Y : Response var (dependent var to explain/predict based on value of the independent var )
- X : explanatory/independent var 
- b : predicted parameter
- e : error

/!\ This model can predict the price of any sized house based on where the value falls on the regression line /!\

* Adjusted Response
^     ^
Y  = Xb 

* residuals
^       ^
e = Y - Y

 * ========== Grossary : ============
- bias : is a "weighing" factor on the interpretation of the results in a more or less hidden way. When we speak of a biased analysis, the results are mathematically correct but their interpretation is distorted by the bias.
- error: generates false results. Basically, if the data is wrong the results are wrong, if the calculation formulas are wrong or inadequate the results are wrong.
- residuals  : represent the portion of variability not explained by the model.
