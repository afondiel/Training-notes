=============== REGRESSION NOTES ==============

- Invented by Francis Galton (1886)

* Goal: 
    - Study correlation between prices
    - Magnetude of relationship (between variables, features of a system ..)


* Applications : 
- medecines (medical models)
- Business (consummer behavior, firm productivity, competiveness of public/private sector)

* Model (Y = mX + b)

(price) 
^  
|  /
| /
|/
+++++-> (surface/size)

X -->[  ? ]--> Y

where : 
- Y : Response var (dependent var to explain/predict based on value of the independent var )
- X : explanatory/independent var 
- m : model(predicted) parameter
- b : error/bias

/!\ This model can predict the price of any sized house based on where the value falls on the regression line /!\

* Adjusted Response
^     ^
Y  = mX 

* Error/residuals
^       ^
b = Y - Y

## SUPERVISED NEURAL NERWORK(NN) : REGRESSION & CLASSIFICATION                      
- Classification : groups data in some classes 
- Regression : predicts values based on line which best models the relationship between the independent(X)
                and dependent variables(Y)
                => Predict values on a continues spectrum rather than discret Classes

* Cost Fonction for linear regression
                  ^
MSE = 1/n*sum(Y - Y)^2 => the derivate gives the Gradien Descent 


* Optimization algorithm (MODEL Optimization ? )

Gradien Descent : 1st order (derivative) to find the minimum value or error of the model 
- pros  : reduce error
- cons : derivate/and matrix inversion ? 

derivate of response based on model parameters (m,b)
f(m,b) = [df/dm] = [ ? ]
         [df/db]   [ ? ]

* Cost ?
* Precision ? 



 * ========== Grossary : ============

- bias : is a "weighing" factor on the interpretation of the results in a more or less hidden way. When we speak of a biased analysis, the results are mathematically correct but their interpretation is distorted by the bias.
- error: generates false results. Basically, if the data is wrong the results are wrong, if the calculation formulas are wrong or inadequate the results are wrong.
- residuals  : represent the portion of variability not explained by the model.
- MSE : mean squared error (erreur quadratique moyenne)
