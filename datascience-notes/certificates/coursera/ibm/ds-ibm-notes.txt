Course 1 : WHAT'S A DATA SCIENCE ? 

//// W1 ///
What's a data science ? 

/!\ Data Science is a process to understand data and do differents things
- keywords : trends, insights, data structured and unstructured, expore, manipulation, find answers, recommendation

# Fundamentals of DS
- Data Analysis (question problem ? => Find Answers => Create Value)
- Data Science ( log files, social medias, email, sales data, patient info files, sports perfomance data, sensor data, seurity camera ...)
- Be curious!!!
- Data visualization => to explain => trends, to tell history, to detect a pattern, new behaiviour ...

# Many path to DS

- Maths : statistics
- Business Analysis & strategies
- SW Engineer
/!\ Soft skills/Qualities : Cusiosity, Take Position=>Confidence, Story teller

# What do Data Scientists do ?
- recomendation algorithm
- Prediction Model
- Find patterns 
- unstructured vs strutured data

# A day in life of Data Scientist ?
- > /!\ Find solution by analyzing datas
- > Curious, fluency in analysis, good communication=>story teller

# Old vs new problems ? 
- old => Predict congestion (uber taxi)
- new => Environment, Climate Changes
- Find (new) solution  : 
		=> Identify the problem  \
		=> Gather datas     	  \ BUILD A MODEL !!!!
		=> Identify 			  /
		=> Tools				 /

# Topics algorithms
- list : regression, data viz, neural net, nearest neighbour, classification ...
- strutured data : ranged /organized data (EXCEL row,colomns) 
- unstructured data :  comes from sensors(video, audio...), web not in row /colomns


# Clouds for Data Scientist ?
- Cloud : Cloud allows to access to data, collaborate easy
- Cloud : storage data, high performance computing, save physocal space in own computer, simulations works in the same data
=> IBM : IBM Cloud
=> Amazon : Amazon Web Services(AWS)
=> Google  : Google Cloud Plateforme
=> Tools : Hadloop, stata ...

# Big Data and Data Mining 

* def *
1st/ approach (traditional) : Statistical analysis
2nd/ Approach : unsupervised + machine-learning algorithms.

* Goal * : to explore hitherto unknown trends and insights by subjecting data to analysis

- Big Data and Data Mining ?
- Foundations of Big Data ?
- What is Hadoop ?

Big Data(BD) : Dynamic, large, Disperate volume of data, created(apps, machine, tools ...)

* 5Vs : 
	=> Velocity : Speed data (quick RT)
	=> Volume :	 Scalable (2,5 quintillons bytes => 10 millions DVDS)
	=> Variety :	Diversity => data come from diffrent Sources (audio, video, img ...) 
	=> Veracity : qlity / origin of data (Releablity, accuracy)
	=> Value : turns data to value (Solution, profits..)

Data scientist extract/drives data from big data
 Tools : 
 => Apache sparks
=> Hadoop (created by Dong Cutting ) => based on Data Cluster, splits data into a pieces to computing a large amount of data (gain speed, performance ...)
 
- How Big Data is Driving Digital Transformation?
		    CEO 

	/ 					\
  CDO						CIO 
(Chief Data Officer)		(Chief Information Officer)

- Data Science Skills & Big Data ?
- Cloud
- Programming Skills
- Python (panda for data viz)
- R
- Unix/Lunix
- Maths(Algebra Statistics)
- Jupyter note book + AWS (Virtual Account)
- BIG DATA (concept created by Google, Statistical technics to handle large data)

- Data Scientists at New York University ?

- Data Mining ?

7 Steps Down the Data Mining : 

1. Establish data mining goals
 - set up goals for the exercise.
 - identify the key questions that need to be answered
 - costs and benefits of exercise
 - Define expected exercise resultats and accuracy
 - High levels of accuracy from data mining would cost more and vice versa.
 
2. Select data

 - The output of a data mining exercise largely depends upon the quality of data being used.
 - Data might be available 
 - If Data not available then go to  : plan new data collection initiatives, including surveys 
 - The type of data, its size, and frequency of collection have a direct bearing on the cost
 - Datas come from differents Databases
 
 
3. Preprocess data
 - clean
 - identify relevant attributes
 - identify the irrelevant attributes of data
 
4. Transform data
 - determine the appropriate format in which data must be stored
 - data mining is to reduce the number of attributes needed to explain the phenomena
  --- using Data reduction algorithms
 - store data in the variables
 
5. Store data
 - Storing Data into the right/good Data mining format for immediate read/write
 - new variables can be created to store data and temporary write/read back into the database
 - store data on servers or storage media that keeps the data secure
 - Data safety and privacy should be a prime concern for storing data.


6. Mine data
 - After data is appropriately processed, transformed, and stored, it is subject to data mining
 - data analysis methods
 - including parametric
 - non-parametric methods, and machine-learning algorithms.
 /!\ - data visualization : good starting point for data mining
 - Multidimensional views of the data
 - data mining software
 - FIND  : HIDDEN trends in the data se
 
7. Evaluate data mining results
 - Extract the result 
 - Do a formal evaluation 
 - > Testing the predictative capabilities of the model
 - > effitiency & of the algorithms in the producing data
 
 /!\ in-sample forecast
 
 -> Share the result w/ Stakeholders
 -> improve the quality of the resultat from the shared feedback

## Deep Learning and Machine Learning ? 
 

## Hands-on Exercise: Data Science Exploration 



## The Final Deliverable

Analytics = comunicate findings (set of insightsin the data) using Tables & plots.

1. define the ingredients and requirements  ? 
2. how to search for background information ?
3. Tools needed to generate the deliverable ?

*tools : grabber

* working w/ Data Scientists : 

- Data Scientists work at the same level as the CIO (Chief Information Officer)
- Passion / DNA / curiosity / sens of humor/ Story teller  
- Communication skills / relatable (relationship esaier)
- Good analysis / Driven - data / Analytics skills ? 
- Company needs : Engineer/Architecture/ Design/ Team expansion
- Technical skills : Statistical, algo, ml, bigdata : datastoring ...

///W3///

### What Analytical Techniques/Methods Do You Need?

- identify the type of data for analysis
- bias vs compensation ?
Ex: Gender Wages(salary) between Men and Women => REGRESSION MODEL !!!
