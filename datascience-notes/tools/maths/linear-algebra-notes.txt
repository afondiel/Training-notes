============ Linear algebra notes ============

- Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning linear equations and linear maps and their representations in 
=> vector spaces
=> through matrices

- vector spaces ?
    => vector : length(magnitude), direction(angle) ...
    => operation : sum, product ...
        => scalar (dot"."product) 
        => cross (x product)
- matrix 
    => transposed
    => identity matrix
    => reversibility condition ?
    => dimension, kernel, image,range ...
    => matrices operation : 
        => sum
        => product 

- polynomial equation : 
    => System of linear equations
        => 2nd , 3rd ... n degre
    => linear 
    => non linear
