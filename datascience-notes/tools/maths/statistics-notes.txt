============ Statistics Notes ============

- Mathematical statistics : is the application of probability theory, a branch of mathematics, to statistics, as opposed to techniques for collecting statistical data

## Types of statistics : 
- Descriptive statistics : data collection + graphical representation
	=> Exploratory analysis : (ex: hystogram) 
- Inferential statistics : the process of using data analysis to infer properties of an underlying distribution of probability

## The (Descriptive) statistics Series :
- Series of positions : average, median, extended, quartile 
- Series of dispersions : variance, Standard deviation

# Application 
(1) Statistics helps in providing a better understanding and accurate description of natureâ€™s phenomena.
(2) Statistics helps in the proper and efficient planning of a statistical inquiry in any field of study.
(3) Statistics helps in collecting appropriate quantitative data.
(4) Statistics helps in presenting complex data in a suitable tabular, diagrammatic and graphic form for an easy and clear comprehension of the data.
(5) Statistics helps in understanding the nature and pattern of variability of a phenomenon through quantitative observations.
(6) Statistics helps in drawing valid inferences, along with a measure of their reliability about the population parameters from the sample data.
