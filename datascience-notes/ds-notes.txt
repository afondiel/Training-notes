Course 1 : What a Data Science ? 


# Big Data and Data Mining 

- Big Data and Data Mining ? 
- Foundations of Big Data ?
- What is Hadoop ?
- How Big Data is Driving Digital Transformation?
- Data Science Skills & Big Data ?
- Data Scientists at New York University ?
- Data Mining ?

* def *
1st/ approach (traditional) : Statistical analysis
2nd/ Approach : unsupervised + machine-learning algorithms.

* Goal * : to explore hitherto unknown trends and insights by subjecting data to analysis

7 Steps Down the Data Mine : 

1. Establish data mining goals
 - set up goals for the exercise.
 - identify the key questions that need to be answered
 - costs and benefits of exercise
 - Define expected exercise resultats and accuracy
 - High levels of accuracy from data mining would cost more and vice versa.
 
2. Select data

 - The output of a data mining exercise largely depends upon the quality of data being used.
 - Data might be available 
 - If Data not available then go to  : plan new data collection initiatives, including surveys 
 - The type of data, its size, and frequency of collection have a direct bearing on the cost
 - Datas come from differents Databases
 
 
3. Preprocess data
 - clean
 - identify relevant attributes
 - identify the irrelevant attributes of data
 
4. Transform data
 - determine the appropriate format in which data must be stored
 - data mining is to reduce the number of attributes needed to explain the phenomena
  --- using Data reduction algorithms
 - store data in the variables
 
5. Store data
 - Storing Data into the right/good Data mining format for immediate read/write
 - new variables can be created to store data and temporary write/read back into the database
 - store data on servers or storage media that keeps the data secure
 - Data safety and privacy should be a prime concern for storing data.


6. Mine data
 - After data is appropriately processed, transformed, and stored, it is subject to data mining
 - data analysis methods
 - including parametric
 - non-parametric methods, and machine-learning algorithms.
 /!\ - data visualization : good starting point for data mining
 - Multidimensional views of the data
 - data mining software
 - FIND  : HIDDEN trends in the data se
 
7. Evaluate data mining results
 - Extract the result 
 - Do a formal evaluation 
 - > Testing the predictative capabilities of the model
 - > effitiency & of the algorithms in the producing data
 
 /!\ in-sample forecast
 
 -> Share the result w/ Stakeholders
 -> improve the quality of the resultat from the shared feedback
