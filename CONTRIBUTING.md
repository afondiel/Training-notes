Rules:

Target audience: [beginner/intermediate/advanced]

- Beginner: 

[Template would emphasize fundamental understanding, basic implementations, and learning resources while minimizing advanced topics]

- intermediate:

[Template would emphasize design patterns, best practices, and performance considerations while assuming fundamental knowledge and minimizing advanced topics]

- Advanced:

[Template would focus on production implementations, system design, and real-world case studies while assuming fundamental knowledge]

Focus area: [core concept/industry application]

Do you understand?
```
### Usage Example:

```md
- Topic: Machine Learning
- Target audience: Beginner
- Focus area: Core Concepts/industry application
```
