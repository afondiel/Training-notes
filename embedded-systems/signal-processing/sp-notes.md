## Overview

```
Signal processing is an electrical engineering subfield that focuses on analyzing, modifying and synthesizing signals, such as sound, images, potential fields, seismic signals, altimetry processing, and scientific measurement
```

## Applications

- **Audio signal processing**– for electrical signals representing sound, such as speech or music
- **Image processing** – in digital cameras, computers and various imaging systems
- **Video processing** – for interpreting moving pictures
- **Wireless communication** – waveform generations, demodulation, filtering, equalization
- **Control systems**
- **Array processing** – for processing signals from arrays of sensors
- **Process control** – a variety of signals are used, including the industry standard 4-20 mA current loop

## Tools & frameworks

- Matlab
- Octave 
- Wolfram
