## Introduction
Programming is the process of creating instructions that a computer can execute to perform specific tasks.

### What's Programming?
- The act of writing code to communicate with machines.
- Used to automate tasks, solve problems, or create software.
- It is fundamental to computer science and software engineering.

### Key Concepts and Terminology
- **Algorithm**: A set of step-by-step instructions to solve a problem.
- **Compiler/Interpreter**: Tools that translate code into machine-executable instructions.
- **Syntax**: Rules that define the structure of programming languages.
- **Variables**: Storage units for data in a program.

### Applications
- Web development (front-end, back-end)
- Mobile app development
- Data science and machine learning
- Robotics and embedded systems

## Fundamentals

### Programming Architecture Pipeline
- Source code is written using a programming language.
- The compiler or interpreter processes the code.
- The executable code interacts with the hardware or software environment.

### How Programming works?
- Programmers write code using high-level languages (e.g., Python, C++).
- Code is translated into machine code.
- The machine code is executed by the computerâ€™s CPU.

### Types of Programming
- **Imperative**: Writing explicit instructions (e.g., C, Java).
- **Declarative**: Describing what to do without detailed steps (e.g., SQL, HTML).
- **Object-oriented**: Organizing code into reusable objects (e.g., Python, Java).
- **Functional**: Focusing on functions and immutability (e.g., Haskell, Lisp).

### Programming paradigm

- Concurrent programming
- Procedural programming
- Oriented Object Programming
- Object Based Programming
- Modular programming

**Concurrent programming (critical systems)**
- Issues: 
  - deadlock(catching same spinlock twice)
  - starving
- Solutions : 
  - mutex, semaphores, atomic code, spinlock

### Some hands-on examples
- Create a simple calculator in Python.
- Develop a web page using HTML and JavaScript.
- Write a basic sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort).

## Tools & Frameworks
- **IDEs**: Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Eclipse.
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub, Bitbucket.
- **Testing**: PyTest, JUnit, Selenium.
- **Frameworks**: Django (Python), React (JavaScript), Spring (Java).

## Hello World!
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Lab: Zero to Hero Projects
- Build a personal website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Develop a to-do list app with Python and Flask.
- Create a basic game using C++ and SDL library.
