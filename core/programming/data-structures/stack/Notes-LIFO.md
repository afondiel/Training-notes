====== = = =  LIFO (Last In First Out) = = =  = ===========

DATA structures help >organize< embedded system control and >storage< of data.

LIFO Buffer : 

-------------------------------------
Producer => Data Buffer ==> Consumer 
-------------------------------------

Producer : Creates and packages data from sensors or connected devices

Data Buffer :  data structure in shared memory implemended between two processing interfaces.

Consumer : Processes data to make decisions, control outputs or communicate externally

-----------
COMMANDS : 
-----------

	-> PUSH : to add data INTO the buffer
	-> POP : to get out data FROM the buffer

LIFO : Adds and removes data items to/from the same end (created with a contigous block of memory like *LINKED LIST*)

=> referred to as a STACK
=> Similar to processor stack, but diferent
