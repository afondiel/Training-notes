## Introduction
![Diagram showing computer vision applications across industries: retail, automotive, healthcare, and agriculture]
- **What**: Computer vision allows computers to emulate human vision by analyzing and processing visual data.
- **Why**: It automates tasks that require visual interpretation, increasing efficiency, accuracy, and scalability in various industries.
- **Where**: Common in industries such as retail (inventory management), healthcare (disease diagnosis), automotive (autonomous driving), and agriculture (crop monitoring).

## Core Concepts
- **Basic principles**:
  - Image acquisition: Capturing images via cameras or sensors.
  - Feature extraction: Identifying edges, shapes, and textures.
  - Pattern recognition: Detecting objects or anomalies.
- **Key components**:
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  - Preprocessing techniques like resizing and normalization.
- **Common misconceptions**:
  - Computer vision is only for tech companies (it's widely used across industries).
  - High-end hardware is always required (cloud-based solutions are available).

## Real-World Applications
### Industry Examples
- **Retail**:
  - Use case: Automated checkout systems (e.g., Amazon Go).
  - Implementation pattern: Object detection for product recognition.
  - Success metric: Reduced checkout times, improved inventory accuracy.
- **Automotive**:
  - Use case: Lane detection in self-driving cars.
  - Implementation pattern: Real-time video analysis.
  - Success metric: Improved road safety and driving efficiency.
- **Healthcare**:
  - Use case: Tumor detection in medical imaging.
  - Implementation pattern: Image segmentation for precise diagnosis.
  - Success metric: Early detection and accurate diagnostics.
- **Agriculture**:
  - Use case: Crop health monitoring.
  - Implementation pattern: Drone-based image capture and analysis.
  - Success metric: Improved yield predictions and pest detection.

### Hands-On Project
**Project**: Build an object detection system for a retail shelf.
- **Goals**: Detect and count products on a store shelf in real-time.
- **Implementation steps**:
  1. Collect a dataset of shelf images with labeled products.
  2. Train a pre-trained YOLO model on the dataset.
  3. Deploy the system for real-time inference using a webcam or smartphone camera.
- **Validation methods**:
  - Compare detected product counts with manual counts.
  - Measure inference time and detection accuracy.
