#  Embedded Sw Engineer Roadmap 

## **1. Master C Programming language**

- Learn C & master IT!
  - Pointers & adresses
  - Multithreading
  - Data Structures
    - Sorting & Filtering
    - LIFO/FIFO
    - Embedded protobuf
- SW Optimization : peformance, power efficiency, cpu loads...

- More advanced programming languages 
  - C++/Python (later)
  - Rust/embedded rust
  - Machine learning 
  - Tiny ML

## **2. Project Mindset**

- Working on Enjoyable project
- Challenge them
  
## **3. Key skills to Master**

After the C/C++, learn Embedded Software Programming  

- What Skills to Focus on? 

  - Super loop/ while (1)/real time main loop
  - GPIOS
  - DAC/DAC
  - INTERRUPTS
  - HW Communication protocols
  	- SPI/QSPI
  	- I2C
  	- UART/USART
  	- BLUETOOTH
  	- USB
  	- ETHERNET
    - DMA : Direct Memory Access

  - **MEMORY Management**
    - How Flashs : Reads/Writes data
    - ROM
    - RAM + NVRoll/NVFix 
  - **Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS)**
    - Multithreadings
