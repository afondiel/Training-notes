=== Overview ===

Created by the Qt Company in 1995, Qt is a framework for creating graphical user interface (GUI) applications. 
It's also a cross-plateform running on Linux, MacOS, Windows and embedded devices. 
It's compatible with C++, python and JS

==== Qt applications workflow ====

1. Design Studio
2. Implementation 
3. Create reuseble componenents
4. Animation
5. Interactions (States/connection)
6. App setup (RT embedded Desktop)
 - RT
 - Embedded
 - Desktop
 - Mobile

==== Qt QML : Language and infrastracture  ==== 

 - the component code is generated automatically in a file.qml from UI

QML modules : 

	Create .qml components and place them into a specific dir
	import moduledir\subdir


==== Qt Quick designer ====
- interface infrastructures to design GUIs for MOBILE and EMBEDDED applications

UI Design : design and prototype the UI experience whithout any code
 - main UI (ui.qml and qml)
 - critical safety elements (Qt safe render)
 
Quick safe renders and standards => "tell-tales" => safety critical part 
Quick language : Qt Safe Renders and safety standards => Tell-tales : safety critical part, these are the warning lamps for things such as airbag, oil level, engine temperature and brakes

==== Qt Designer  ====

- interface infrastructures to design GUIs for desktop applications
- Tools : Qt Widgets Application. 

==== Devices ====
 - Desktop
 - Mobile 
 - Embedded
	NXP widely used is  : 
 		- i.MX6 CPU
 		- i.MX6 GPU 

==== Get started ====

UI quick : 
 - Components(sender, receiver...)
 - signals
 - Animation 


==== Cross-platform ====

Qt Project (.pro) File is actually the project file used by "qmake" to build
your application, library, or plugin.
