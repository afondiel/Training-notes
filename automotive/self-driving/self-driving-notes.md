## Overview

A self-driving car, also known as an autonomous car, driver-less car, or "robotic car" (robo-car),is a car incorporating vehicular automation, 
that is, a ground vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input.

## How a self-driving car works ?

         c2-->a1
```

- Computer vision : how the car sees the world and its environement
- Sensor Fusion : how the car understands the world and its environement
- Localization : how the car figure it out where it is in the world(its location)
- Path Planning : how the car decides to navige the world(its brain/decision making)
- Control (drive) : how the car turns the steering wheel/accelates/brakes based on the planning phase


## Applications
- Increase road Safety 
- Vehicle automation in different fields
- Landmark assistance in local positioning systems
- Control of the automated vehicle
- Automated vehicle path planning
- Obstacle avoidance
- autonomous taxis (waymo, uber ...)
- ...


## HW and SW Architecture

There are currently two software architecture approaches commonly used in the autonomous industry: Modular and [End-to-End](https://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf) approach.

### Hardware

#### Sensors

![passive-and-active-sensors](https://github.com/afondiel/computer-science-notebook/blob/master/embedded-systems/sensors/resources/The-frequency-bands-of-the-passive-and-active-sensors-for-optical-imaging-and-for-radio.png?raw=true)

- There are two categories of sensors: `active sensors` and `passive sensors`
- Each sensor operates in a different frequency range based on electromagnetic spectrum or radiation.

![EM spectrum](./resources/EM_spectrum_full.jpg)

The electromagnetic radiation (EMR) consists of a `frequency` ( $f$ ) and a `wavelength` ( $\lambda$ ).

$$
f = 
\frac{c}{\lambda}
$$

```
Where, c is the speed of light ( $3.10^8$ m/s)
```

**Sensors types** 


##### `Cameras`

Passive & light-collecting sensors that are used for capturing rich detailed information about a scene. Also essential for correctly perceiving.
- Comparison metrics:
  - `Resolution` (quality of the image) : number of pixels that create the image (l x w)
  - `Field of view (FOV)` : the horizontal and vertical angular extent that is *visible* to the camera (depending lens selection and zoom)
  - `Dynamic Range` : the difference btw the **darkest** and **lightest** tones in an image
    - High Dynamic range (HDR) is essential for self-driving vehicles to navigate in variable lighting conditions, particularly at night.
- Trade-off btw resolution and FOV ?
  - Wilder `field of view` allows a larger viewing region in the environment but fewer pixels that absorb light from one particular object
  - FOV increases, the resolution needs to be increases as well, to still be able to perceive with the same quality
  - other properties that affect perception : 
    - focal length, depth of field and frame rate
    - further explanation **on course 3 : visual perception**
- **Cameras types** :
  - `Stereo Camera`: the combination of two cameras with overlapping FOVs and aligned image planes.
    - enables depth estimation from image data (synchronized image pairs)
    - Pixel values from image can be matched to the other image producing a disparity map of the scene then be used to estimate depth at each pixel
  - `Monocular camera`
  - `fisheye camera (360)`
  - [Thermal Cameras](https://www.flir.com/oem/adas/)


##### `Radar (Radio Detection and Ranging)`

Radar : detects Macro and moving objects
    - Long range
    - Short range
  - Metrics :
    - Range : 
      - F : < 300GHz
      - $\lambda$ : >= 1mm
```mermaid
 graph LR

         a1[Radar]-->|T|a2[Object]
         a2-.->|R|a1
```


##### `Lidar` (Light Detection and Ranging) 

Lidar detects small objects, more precise than radars, and good for bad weahter

```mermaid
 graph LR

         a1[Lidar]-->|T-Laser Beam|a2[Object]
         a2-.->|R|a1
```
  - Based on laser detector
  - Rotational and optical system
  - Great electronic timing (detection speed)
  - 3D mapping
  - Scan of the environment

$$
\displaystyle D_{L} = 
\frac{c*t}{2}
$$

    where  : 
    - D : the distance btw the sensor and the Object
    - c : the speed of light
    - t : time

##### `Sonar`: Sound Waves 
  
```mermaid
 graph LR

         a1[Sonar]-->|T|a2[Object]
         a2-.->|R|a1
```

$$
D_{S} = 
\frac{V*T}{2}
$$
```
where  : 
- D : the distance btw the sensor and the Object
- V : the speed of sound
- T : time
```

##### [GNSS(Global Navigation Satellite System )](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation)

##### [Odometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odometry)

##### InfraRed (IR)
#### Sensors strenght and weakness  

![sensor for AV](https://i0.wp.com/semiengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/Ansys_choose-right-sensors-for-AV-table1.png?ssl=1)

`RADAR vs LIDAR`
  - Radar : the detection of the object increases as the size of this one
    - Range  : < 1 mm*
    - very good in case of bad wheather
    - Radar wavelength is three times greater than Lidar : 
    - better for macro-dimension detection or bigger objects 
$$
\displaystyle \lambda_{R} > 3*\lambda_{L}
$$

- Lidar : detect objects in the dimensions more smaller 
    - Range : 1 nm < wavelenght < 1um 
    - not very good in bad wheather
