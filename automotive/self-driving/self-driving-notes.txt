====== Self-driving-notes ======

A "self-driving car", also known as an "autonomous car", driver-less car, or "robotic car" (robo-car),is a car incorporating vehicular automation, 
that is, a ground vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input.

## How a self-driving car works ? (by David Silver from Udacity)

- Computer vision : how the car sees the world and its environement
- Sensor Fusion : how the car understands the world and its environement
- Localization : how the car figure it out where it is in the world(its location)
- Path Planning : how the car decides to navige the world(its brain/decision making)
- Control (drive) : how the car turns the steering wheel/accelates/brakes based on the planning phase


Applications : 
- increase road Safety 
- Vehicle automation in different fields
- Landmark assistance in local positioning systems
- Control of the automated vehicle
- Automated vehicle path planning
- Obstacle avoidance
- autonomous taxis (waymo, uber ...)
...
