============ Deep Learning Notes==============

Deep learning : is Machine Learning (ML) subset based on artificial *neural networks* to perform sophisticated computations on large amounts of data

## Neural Network(NN): simulates the way humans learn. 
- NN allows to build model/algorithms 

## Application
- computer vision 
- Object detection 
- nlp 
- Virtual assistant 
- Autonomous vehicles 
- Face recognition 
- Chatbots
- Sound addition to silent films
- colorization of black and white images ...
 ...
- eveywhere since data is everywhere in modern world and taking part of daily life ...
