```

## Applications 

- Text
- Code
- Images
- Molecules
- Music
- Video
- Robot Actions
- ...


## Tool & Frameworks

- ChatGPT 
- Bing Chat (OpenAI using their GPT-3 and GPT-4 based on large language models)
- Bard chatbot (Google using their LaMDA foundation model) 
- Other generative AI models include artificial intelligence art systems such as :
  - Stable Diffusion 
  - Midjourney
  - DALL-E
